          I am a student in VUsec computer security program.
          I am doing research on microarchitecture security currently.
          I'm interested in lots of topics about security such as fuzzing, system security etc.
          VUsec courses are very hard, making people abnormal to some extends. I am lucky to pass the 
          core courses: Binary Analysis and Malware, Software Security, Hardware Security.
