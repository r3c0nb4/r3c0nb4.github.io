        details: |   
          I am a student enrolled in the VUsec computer security program, where I am currently 
          engaged in research on microarchitecture security. My interests span a wide range of 
          security topics, including fuzzing, system security, and more. The rigorous courses 
          offered by VUsec are known for their difficulty, often pushing students to their 
          limits (drive students to the brink of insanity). Fortunately, I have successfully completed 
          core courses such as Binary Analysis and Malware, Software Security, and Hardware Security.
