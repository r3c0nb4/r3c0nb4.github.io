          I am a student enrolled in the VUsec computer security program, where I am currently 
          engaged in research on microarchitecture security. My interests span a wide range of 
          security topics, including fuzzing, system security, and more. The rigorous courses 
          offered by VUsec are known for their difficulty, often pushing students to their 
          limits (drive students to the brink of insanity). Fortunately, I have successfully completed 
          core courses such as Binary Analysis and Malware, Software Security, and Hardware Security.

          In 2018, I began using Linux on my laptop and developed an interest in computer security. 
          The following year, I joined the IT center and worked as an operations and maintenance engineer. 
          My campus was located in Weihai, a city in Shandong Province. Initially, I pursued studies in 
          the Accounting and Finance track, but switched my major to Computer Science during my second 
          year for various reasons. Unfortunately, if you're hoping for more stories from that time, I 
          regret to say that I don't remember.

          During my internship, my primary focus was on web security. I conducted tests on various client 
          websites and honed my skills in web penetration testing. As for further details, I must maintain 
          confidentiality for the sake of our clients. :)
